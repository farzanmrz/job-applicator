## WORKEXPERIENCE

## Optium Data Solutions LLP - Lead System Architect,

## New Delhi, India: June 2022 - August 2023

- · Implemented a cross-platform ERP system, by leading a team of 10+ developers to streamline modules across procurement, manufacturing, HR, accounting, and sales.
- · Integrated Laravel backend with Angular web and Android frontends in AGILE manner, leveraging a MySQL stack and AWS services (EC2, RDS, S3) with GitLab CI/CD pipelines for a dynamic deployment system.
- · Conducted daily client check-ins to align team deliverables with their expectations and adapt system functionalities accordingly, effectively bridging the client-team gap and elevating client satisfaction

## KEY PROJECTS

## AI Research: 2D Context Transformer for Spreadsheet Metadata Prediction : August 2024 - Present

- · Pioneered a transformer model architecture designed to capture 2D contextual relationships within and around each cell for accurate metadata prediction of spreadsheets.
- · Developed a GPU-accelerated, batch-optimized tensor representation for spreadsheets to enable computationally efficient, faster training of model with no loss in performance.
- · Adapted the SAFFU model with BPE tokenizer for reduced vocab size and enhanced 2D context capturing using self-attentive feed-forward layers, optimizing training and improving model performance.

## Adversarial Abstractive Summarizer with BART and CNN Models : March 2024 - June 2024

- · Developed a GAN-based abstractive summarization model, employing BART for summary generation and a CNN-based discriminator with Word2Vec embeddings to classify summaries as human or machine-generated.
- · Optimized training with policy gradient updates, leveraging adversarial feedback from discriminator evaluations to generate progressively more human-like summaries.
- · Outperformed all baseline models in original research across ROUGE metrics, achieving a notable 16-point gain in ROUGE-2, indicating coherent and contextually enhanced human-like summary generation

## Stock Movement Prediction :

October 2023 - December 2023

- · Analyzed the latest two months of S&amp;P500 stock data, applying feature engineering to 5-minute intra-day intervals, to conduct time-series analysis and predict stock direction across 66 stocks
- · Designed ensemble models using native classifiers with a weighted voting scheme and RandomForest
- · Illustrated effectiveness of ensemble techniques by achieving &gt; 65% prediction accuracy
