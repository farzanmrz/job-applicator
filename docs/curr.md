# Profile Manager: Microservices Architecture with NoSQL Storage

The Profile Manager will use a microservices architecture with MongoDB as its NoSQL database. Instead of a monolithic user profile, we'll separate data into independent collections (education, work experience, skills, etc.) that are linked to a user ID, allowing each component to evolve independently. This approach provides flexibility for your evolving requirements while maintaining relationships between profile elements.

For extraction, replace the current multi-agent approach with a more efficient single-pass LLM extraction using carefully crafted prompts and Pydantic models for validation. The workflow becomes: (1) convert document to markdown, (2) extract structured data via LLM, (3) validate output, and (4) store in appropriate collection.

When new information arrives from different sources, implement a comparison service that identifies matching entries using key identifiers (institution name, dates) and updates records based on completeness and recency. For text fields where exact matching is insufficient, you can optionally incorporate vector embeddings for semantic similarity comparison.

This architecture allows you to start with a focused implementation for education data and expand to other profile components incrementally, providing both the structure and flexibility your job applicator system needs.
