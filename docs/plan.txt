Autonomous Multi-Agent Job Search and Application System
Project Intent and Overarching Goals
This project aims to create an intelligent, autonomous system that handles the entire job search and application process with minimal human intervention. The core vision is to develop a network of specialized AI agents that work together to discover relevant job opportunities, maintain a comprehensive professional profile, and streamline the application process—all operating seamlessly in the background.
The fundamental goals of this system are:
•	Autonomous Job Discovery: Enable intelligent agents to find and analyze job opportunities across various platforms without manual intervention. Unlike simple scrapers, these agents should be capable of dynamically navigating any job site given only a URL, applying consistent search parameters across different interfaces.
•	Intelligent Profile Management: Create and maintain a unified professional profile that aggregates information from multiple sources (resume, LinkedIn, GitHub), recognizing when the same project or experience appears across different platforms. This goes beyond simple keyword extraction to develop a semantic understanding of qualifications.
•	Automated Application Process: Streamline job applications through intelligent document customization, response generation for application questions, and automated submissions where possible. The system should recognize similar questions across applications and reuse appropriate responses.
•	Background Operation: Ensure the entire system functions efficiently in the background without requiring active monitoring. The system should operate asynchronously on scheduled intervals to discover and evaluate new job opportunities while maintaining cost efficiency.
The ultimate vision is to create a "job market PR agent and assistant" that eliminates the chaos of maintaining streamlined information across multiple platforms, continuously updates the user's professional profile, and autonomously handles the repetitive aspects of job searching and application.
System Architecture
The system is structured as a network of specialized agents that process and refine data in a bottom-up flow, with sub-agents feeding information to manager agents that coordinate activities. This architecture enables efficient information processing and autonomous decision-making throughout the job search and application lifecycle.
Information Flow and Component Relationship
The system operates through several layers of processing, with information flowing from specialized sub-agents up to manager agents and ultimately to an orchestrator that supervises the entire process:
Profile Information Collection and Management: At the foundation level, four specialized sub-agents (Resume, LinkedIn, GitHub, Other) gather and process information about the user's professional background. These agents extract detailed information from their respective sources and feed it upward to the Profile Manager. The Profile Manager synthesizes this information into a comprehensive, semantically rich "Unified Profile" document that represents the user's complete professional identity.
Job Search and Collection: In parallel, four specialized sub-agents (LinkedIn, Company, Dynamic, Indeed) actively search for job opportunities across different platforms. Unlike in traditional architectures where managers direct sub-agents, these specialized agents autonomously navigate their respective platforms and feed discovered opportunities upward to the Search Manager. The Search Manager consolidates these findings into a "Potential Job List" document, removing duplicates and standardizing the format.
Orchestration and Evaluation: The Orchestrator sits at the center of the system, receiving both the Unified Profile and Potential Job List. It coordinates the overall workflow and passes this information to the Job Evaluator. The Job Evaluator applies sophisticated matching algorithms to rank each job opportunity based on relevance to the profile, posting date, company reputation, and other factors, producing a "Ranked Job List" document.
Application Process: The Application Manager receives the Ranked Job List and processes each job opportunity in priority order. For each application, two specialized agents work simultaneously:
•	The "App Doc/Form Req" agent analyzes the application requirements and form questions
•	The "Company Info" agent researches the company's profile, mission, and relevant projects
These inputs feed into two processing agents:
•	The "Self Doc Tuner" customizes the user's resume and cover letter specifically for each application
•	The "Form Answer Generator" creates optimized responses to application questions
The system includes an intelligent decision point that determines whether human input is required for certain questions. When needed, it requests user input; otherwise, it proceeds autonomously. The "Actual Applicator" agent then takes the optimized documents and answers to complete and submit the application.
This architecture represents a significant advancement over traditional linear workflows, as it allows for parallel processing, intelligent decision-making, and adaptive responses to the unique requirements of each job opportunity and application process.
Phased Implementation Plan
The following numbered entries correspond to each implementation phase of the project, progressing from an initial MVP to a fully autonomous system.
1.	LinkedIn Job Search MVP: We'll establish basic functionality for automated job discovery on LinkedIn, creating the foundation for the broader system. The implementation begins with creating LinkedIn login automation via Playwright, ensuring secure credential handling. We'll develop scraping routines to extract and store LinkedIn jobs in structured JSON format. A basic semantic ranking system using embedded keywords (provided manually at this stage) will help prioritize opportunities. The system will be configured with APScheduler to enable background operation, allowing job searches to run at scheduled intervals without user intervention.
Success Criteria: The system successfully logs into LinkedIn, retrieves job listings based on predefined keywords, and presents them to the user in a ranked order through the Streamlit interface.
Stack: Streamlit for frontend interface, Playwright for browser automation, JSON for data storage, APScheduler for background tasks, Sentence-Transformers for semantic matching.
2.	Resume-Based Profile Agent: We'll add backward integration with the user's resume, eliminating the need for manually provided keywords by extracting them directly from resume documents. Development focuses on creating PDF resume parsing capability that handles various resume formats. The system will extract skills, experiences, and education information automatically, then generate embeddings for these elements to enable semantic matching. These dynamically extracted keywords will be integrated into the Search Manager for improved job discovery without requiring manual input.
