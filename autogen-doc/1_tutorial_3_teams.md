### Teams [#](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/reference/agentchat/teams#teams)
In this section you’ll learn how to create a *multi-agent team* (or simply team) using AutoGen. A team is a group of agents that work together to achieve a common goal.
We’ll first show you how to create and run a team. We’ll then explain how to observe the team’s behavior, which is crucial for debugging and understanding the team’s performance, and common operations to control the team’s behavior.

AgentChat supports several team presets:
*   `RoundRobinGroupChat`: A team that runs a group chat with participants taking turns in a round-robin fashion (covered on this page). [Tutorial](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/tutorial/groupchat)
*   `SelectorGroupChat`: A team that selects the next speaker using a `ChatCompletion` model after each message. [Tutorial](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/tutorial/selector)
*   `MagenticOneGroupChat`: A generalist multi-agent system for solving open-ended web and file-based tasks across a variety of domains. [Tutorial](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/tutorial/magentic)
*   `Swarm`: A team that uses `HandoffMessage` to signal transitions between agents. [Tutorial](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/tutorial/swarm)

:::note Note
**When should you use a team?**
Teams are for complex tasks that require collaboration and diverse expertise. However, they also demand more scaffolding to steer compared to single agents. While AutoGen simplifies the process of working with teams, start with a single agent for simpler tasks, and transition to a multi-agent team when a single agent proves inadequate. Ensure that you have optimized your single agent with the appropriate tools and instructions before moving to a team-based approach.
:::

#### Creating a Team [#](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/reference/agentchat/teams#creating-a-team)
`RoundRobinGroupChat` is a simple yet effective team configuration where all agents share the same context and take turns responding in a round-robin fashion. Each agent, during its turn, broadcasts its response to all other agents, ensuring that the entire team maintains a consistent context.

We will begin by creating a team with two `AssistantAgent` and a `TextMentionTermination` condition that stops the team when a specific word is detected in the agent’s response.
The two-agent team implements the *reflection* pattern, a multi-agent design pattern where a critic agent evaluates the responses of a primary agent. Learn more about the reflection pattern using the Core API.

```python
import asyncio

from autogen_agentchat.agents import AssistantAgent
from autogen_agentchat.base import TaskResult
from autogen_agentchat.conditions import ExternalTermination, TextMentionTermination
from autogen_agentchat.teams import RoundRobinGroupChat
from autogen_agentchat.ui import Console
from autogen_core import CancellationToken
from autogen_ext.models.openai import OpenAIChatCompletionClient

# Create an OpenAI model client.
model_client = OpenAIChatCompletionClient(
    model="gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
    # api_key="sk-...", # Optional if you have an OPENAI_API_KEY env variable set.
)

# Create the primary agent.
primary_agent = AssistantAgent(
    "primary",
    model_client=model_client,
    system_message="You are a helpful AI assistant.",
)

# Create the critic agent.
critic_agent = AssistantAgent(
    "critic",
    model_client=model_client,
    system_message="Provide constructive feedback. Respond with 'APPROVE' to when your feedbacks are addressed.",
)

# Define a termination condition that stops the task if the critic approves.
text_termination = TextMentionTermination("APPROVE")

# Create a team with the primary and critic agents.
team = RoundRobinGroupChat([primary_agent, critic_agent], termination_condition=text_termination)
```


#### Running a Team [#](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/reference/agentchat/teams#running-a-team)
Let’s call the `run()` method to start the team with a task.

```python
# Use `asyncio.run(...)` when running in a script.
result = await team.run(task="Write a short poem about the fall season.")
print(result)
```


```
TaskResult(messages=[TextMessage(source='user', models_usage=None, content='Write a short poem about the fall season.', type='TextMessage'), TextMessage(source='primary', models_usage=RequestUsage(prompt_tokens=28, completion_tokens=109), content="Leaves of amber, gold, and rust, \nDance upon the gentle gust. \nCrisp air whispers tales of old, \nAs daylight wanes, the night grows bold. \n\nPumpkin patch and apple treats, \nLaughter in the street repeats. \nSweaters warm and fires aglow, \nIt's time for nature's vibrant show. \n\nThe harvest moon ascends the sky, \nWhile geese in formation start to fly. \nAutumn speaks in colors bright, \nA fleeting grace, a pure delight. ", type='TextMessage'), TextMessage(source='critic', models_usage=RequestUsage(prompt_tokens=154, completion_tokens=200), content='Your poem beautifully captures the essence of the fall season with vivid imagery and a rhythmic flow.

A few tweaks to include multisensory details could elevate it even further.', type='TextMessage'), TextMessage(source='primary', models_usage=RequestUsage(prompt_tokens=347, completion_tokens=178), content="Thank you for the thoughtful feedback.

Thank you again for your suggestions!", type='TextMessage'), TextMessage(source='critic', models_usage=RequestUsage(prompt_tokens=542, completion_tokens=3), content='APPROVE', type='TextMessage')], stop_reason="Text 'APPROVE' mentioned")
```


The team runs the agents until the termination condition was met. In this case, the team ran agents following a round-robin order until the termination condition was met when the word “APPROVE” was detected in the agent’s response. When the team stops, it returns a `TaskResult` object with all the messages produced by the agents in the team.

#### Observing a Team [#](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/reference/agentchat/teams#observing-a-team)
Similar to the agent’s `on_messages_stream()` method, you can stream the team’s messages while it is running by calling the `run_stream()` method. This method returns a generator that yields messages produced by the agents in the team as they are generated, with the final item being the `TaskResult` object.

```python
# When running inside a script, use a async main function and call it from `asyncio.run(...)`.
await team.reset() # Reset the team for a new task.
async for message in team.run_stream(task="Write a short poem about the fall season."): # type: ignore
    if isinstance(message, TaskResult):
        print("Stop Reason:", message.stop_reason)
    else:
        print(message)
```

As demonstrated in the example above, you can determine the reason why the team stopped by checking the `stop_reason` attribute.
The `Console()` method provides a convenient way to print messages to the console with proper formatting.

```python
await team.reset() # Reset the team for a new task.
await Console(team.run_stream(task="Write a short poem about the fall season.")) # Stream the messages to the console.

#### Resetting a Team [#](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/reference/agentchat/teams#resetting-a-team)
You can reset the team by calling the `reset()` method. This method will clear the team’s state, including all agents. It will call the each agent’s `on_reset()` method to clear the agent’s state.

```python
await team.reset() # Reset the team for the next run.
```


It is usually a good idea to reset the team if the next task is not related to the previous task. However, if the next task is related to the previous task, you don’t need to reset and you can instead resume the team.

#### Stopping a Team [#](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/reference/agentchat/teams#stopping-a-team)
Apart from automatic termination conditions such as `TextMentionTermination` that stops the team based on the internal state of the team, you can also stop the team from outside by using the `ExternalTermination`.

Calling `set()` on `ExternalTermination` will stop the team when the current agent’s turn is over. Thus, the team may not stop immediately. This allows the current agent to finish its turn and broadcast the final message to the team before the team stops, keeping the team’s state consistent.

```python
# Create a new team with an external termination condition.
external_termination = ExternalTermination()
team = RoundRobinGroupChat(
    [primary_agent, critic_agent],
    termination_condition=external_termination | text_termination, # Use the bitwise OR operator to combine conditions.
)

# Run the team in a background task.
run = asyncio.create_task(Console(team.run_stream(task="Write a short poem about the fall season.")))

# Wait for some time.
await asyncio.sleep(0.1)

# Stop the team.
external_termination.set()

# Wait for the team to finish.
await run
```


```

Leaves of amber, gold, and red, Gently drifting from trees overhead. Whispers of wind through the crisp, cool air, Nature's canvas painted with care.

Pumpkins aglow with autumn's light, Harvest feasts and stars so bright. In every leaf and breeze that calls, We find the magic of glorious fall.

From the output above, you can see the team stopped because the external termination condition was met, but the speaking agent was able to finish its turn before the team stopped.

#### Resuming a Team [#](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/reference/agentchat/teams#resuming-a-team)
Teams are stateful and maintains the conversation history and context after each run, unless you reset the team.
You can resume a team to continue from where it left off by calling the `run()` or `run_stream()` method again without a new task. `RoundRobinGroupChat` will continue from the next agent in the round-robin order.

```python
await Console(team.run_stream()) # Resume the team to continue the last task.
```

---------- critic ----------
This poem beautifully captures the essence of the fall season with vivid imagery and a soothing rhythm. The descriptions of the changing leaves, cool air, and various autumn traditions make it easy for readers to envision and feel the charm of fall. Here are a few suggestions to enhance its impact: 1. **Structure Variation**: Consider breaking some lines with a hyphen or ellipsis for dramatic effect or emphasis. For instance, “Sweaters wrapped tight as twilight nears— / Fall’s charming embrace, as warm as it appears." 2. **Sensory Details**: While the poem already evokes visual and tactile senses, incorporating other senses such as sound or smell could deepen the immersion. For example, include the scent of wood smoke or the crunch of leaves underfoot. 3. **Metaphorical Language**: Adding metaphors or similes can further enrich the imagery. For example, you might compare the leaves falling to a golden rain or the chill in the air to a gentle whisper. Overall, it’s a lovely depiction of fall. These suggestions are minor tweaks that might elevate the reader's experience even further. Nice work! Let me know if these feedbacks are addressed.

Your revisions have made the poem even more evocative and immersive. The use of sensory details, such as "whispers of wind" and "crackling leaves," beautifully enriches the poem, engaging multiple senses. The metaphorical language, like "a golden rain from trees’ canopies" and "Fall’s embrace, warm as whispered years," adds depth and enhances the emotional warmth of the poem. The structural variation with the inclusion of dashes effectively adds emphasis and flow.

#### Aborting a Team [#](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/reference/agentchat/teams#aborting-a-team)
You can abort a call to `run()` or `run_stream()` during execution by setting a `CancellationToken` passed to the `cancellation_token` parameter.
Different from stopping a team, aborting a team will immediately stop the team and raise a `CancelledError` exception.

:::note Note
The caller will get a `CancelledError` exception when the team is aborted.
:::

```python
# Create a cancellation token.
cancellation_token = CancellationToken()

# Use another coroutine to run the team.
run = asyncio.create_task(
    team.run(
        task="Translate the poem to Spanish.",
        cancellation_token=cancellation_token,
    )
)

# Cancel the run.
cancellation_token.cancel()

try:
    result = await run # This will raise a CancelledError.
except asyncio.CancelledError:
    print("Task was cancelled.")
```


```
Task was cancelled.
```


#### Single-Agent Team [#](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/reference/agentchat/teams#single-agent-team)
Often, you may want to run a single agent in a team configuration. This is useful for running the `AssistantAgent` in a loop until a termination condition is met.
This is different from running the `AssistantAgent` using its `run()` or `run_stream()` method, which only runs the agent for one step and returns the result. See AssistantAgent for more details about a single step.

Here is an example of running a single agent in a `RoundRobinGroupChat` team configuration with a `TextMessageTermination` condition. The task is to increment a number until it reaches 10 using a tool. The agent will keep calling the tool until the number reaches 10, and then it will return a final `TextMessage` which will stop the run.

```python
from autogen_agentchat.agents import AssistantAgent
from autogen_agentchat.conditions import TextMessageTermination
from autogen_agentchat.teams import RoundRobinGroupChat
from autogen_agentchat.ui import Console
from autogen_ext.models.openai import OpenAIChatCompletionClient

model_client = OpenAIChatCompletionClient(
    model="gpt-4o",
    # api_key="sk-...", # Optional if you have an OPENAI_API_KEY env variable set.
    # Disable parallel tool calls for this example.
    parallel_tool_calls=False, # type: ignore
)

# Create a tool for incrementing a number.
def increment_number(number: int) -> int:
    """Increment a number by 1."""
    return number + 1

# Create a tool agent that uses the increment_number function.
looped_assistant = AssistantAgent(
    "looped_assistant",
    model_client=model_client,
    tools=[increment_number], # Register the tool.
    system_message="You are a helpful AI assistant, use the tool to increment the number.",
)

# Termination condition that stops the task if the agent responds with a text message.
termination_condition = TextMessageTermination("looped_assistant")

# Create a team with the looped assistant agent and the termination condition.
team = RoundRobinGroupChat(
    [looped_assistant],
    termination_condition=termination_condition,
)

# Run the team with a task and print the messages to the console.
async for message in team.run_stream(task="Increment the number 5 to 10."): # type: ignore
    print(type(message).__name__, message)

await model_client.close()
```

```


The key is to focus on the termination condition. In this example, we use a `TextMessageTermination` condition that stops the team when the agent stops producing `ToolCallSummaryMessage`. The team will keep running until the agent produces a `TextMessage` with the final result.

You can also use other termination conditions to control the agent. See Termination Conditions for more details.
