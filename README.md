# Job Applicator: Multi-Agent Framework for Autonomous Job Search

Job Applicator is an AI-powered multi-agent system designed to automate the job search and application process. The system intelligently discovers, evaluates, and applies to job opportunities on LinkedIn that match your professional profile.

## Features

The system consists of five specialized agents:

1. **Profile Agent**: Understands your professional identity and skills
2. **Search Agent**: Discovers relevant job opportunities on LinkedIn
3. **Evaluation Agent**: Assesses job fit against your profile
4. **Application Agent**: Handles the submission process
5. **Coordinator Agent**: Orchestrates the entire system

Each agent works autonomously while collaborating through a common messaging framework.
